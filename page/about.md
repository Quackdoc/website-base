# About

Going by the online handle Quackdoc, I have been around computers for just about all of my life, starting off with a windows 98 toshiba satellite I had very early exposure to windows. I remained using windows for a long time an avid user of Windows XP is where I spent most of my time gaming and playing on PCs. The first Linux operating system I used full for a prolonged period of time was actually Xebian, debian for the xbox. I had played with linux before, Slackware and Arch. However found the novelty of running linux on an xbox quite alluring. 

This was actually what originally got me into using Linux full time on my personal PCs, I distro hopped tons, from ubuntu, knoppix, slack, suse etc. I tried most of the big distros and eventually found myself on arch. While I do still distro hop on my laptops and other miscelanious machines I primairly run arch on my home desktop. 

At one point, I may have called myself a tech enthusiast. I don't really think this accurately describes me anymore. While I do still get excited about interesting new tech like upcomming riscv platoforms, S76's cosmic DE and all sorts of stuff. I find myself more and more annoyed with computing as I go. I regularly switch between Windows and Linux. Because of this I am overly aware of the flaws in both. No matter what operating system I try, From Windows, ReactOS, Linux distros, Android and even OSX. I can't help but feel overly annoyed at little things that feel so wrong no matter where you go. This is largely the reason I have settled on Arch. I don't believe arch is the best OS, I just simply think it's the least worst. 

In the end, Since I can't escape tech, I can at least try to make it as bearable as I can for myself. The blog I have will largely be about sharing small bits of information about the large variety of tech I stumble across. However I will from time to time post tutorials, Information about various tech, and other misc bits and bobs. I also plan on using this page to reccomend various projects and software collections I personally use to make the tech I use on a daily basis less painful to use.
