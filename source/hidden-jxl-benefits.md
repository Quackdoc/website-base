# Jpeg-xl is kinda cool.
##### It is highly reccomended to read the notes section after reading this page.

While many of the benefits of JXL have been told a lot, there are some things about JXL that I really think should be more popular. JXL is so jam packed full of features that some of the real gems have been ignored. These gems are often features that can be utilized either today, or in a possible short term future.

Note: in this article, when I talk about HDR, I am talking explicitly about the intended "Brightness" of the image. HDR is a poorly, if at all, defined term. However the general use of it seems to be talking about the potential discernible brightness differences within an image. This is how it is used here.

## XYB, more then just compression. Are weird colors a problem of the past?

Colorspaces are complicated things, they are a product of trying to squeeze the absolute best they can out of the hardware they are designed for, They have historically had severe limits, but first, a quick primer as to why they are needed.

#### I thought we learned about color in primary school...

Images are made of pixels. This is fairly common knowledge, However did you know that we can actually represent and store pixels in a large variety of formats? "But why quack?" It turns out that human eyes, are extremely complicated. With that complexity they also become very flexible and very powerful things, being able to adapt to a large variety of viewing conditions.

Content creators wish to make the best looking pictures and videos they can, because of this they want to be able to maximize the flexibility and capacity of the images to the best of their capability. Sadly, the hardware we have today is no where near good enough to make the best use out of human vision. Obviously hardware 10 years ago, 20 years ago, and obviously more so 30 years was even worse then it is today.

YUV/YCbCr and RGB are pixel formats you may have heard of, This refers to how the pixels themselves are stored. They are formats a display can receive and utilize directly, and are designed to be effectively negligible in speed to convert back and forth from. This was something very important back before the 2000s when hardware was much weaker then it is today. Doing conversions could actually have a noticeable performance penalty back then. We can consider these "Display based formats." Since they try their best to model data in formats they can be displayed in. However we can't simply store the raw YUV or RGB data, Not only does this take up a *lot* of space, Displays can't handle the vast majority of the data we could actually store here anyways, so we assign colorspaces to this data so we can make the best use of the data by optimizing it for the display we are using.

These colorspaces while great for size and speed, have severe limitations explicitly because they are typically designed for the limitations of the displays they target. This means they really aren't the most flexible, the defacto standard we use for images *today* was designed for **CRT DISPLAYS**, sRGB came out in the 90s... For anyone who is familiar with the pace of technology, this is ancient. In fact, this would be considered "retro" by other standards. Yet we still use it today.

OF COURSE content creators weren't satisfied with this, why would they be? I doubt anyone average person has used a CRT in over a decade now. Because of this, there are many more modern colorspaces available to better fit the displays we use. In fact many displays can actually support multiple of these different colorspaces now, Technology has progressed a lot after all, However the standards we use and default to haven't. Because of this we can only display one colorspace at a time, and while we can convert between colorspaces. The methodology for doing this is vast, and leads to a variety of both good and bad results. 

Because of this incongruity, we are still mostly stuck with sRGB. Since sRGB is the default, people master content for sRGB the most. Because of the fact people master content for sRGB the most, manufacturers default to sRGB. A classic catch 22, the chicken and egg problem. This is made worse by Windows and Linux having poor support for color management. Apple excels in this at the very least.

So, what is the XYB thing? Why is this different? Well XYB is an LMS based format. This probably doesn't mean much to a lot of people and that's fine. The super TLDR is that instead of modeling how displays emit light, LMS based formats model how humans perceive light. This means the limitations of LMS are actually based on how humans perceive light, instead of how displays produce it. This means we can consider LMS to be a "Human based format" Instead of being a "Display based format". If that you remember I said storing raw RGB or YUV is expensive, This is the exact same case for LMS. However XYB is a modification of LMS designed to be a lot more efficient to store, and it works very well.

So JXL can store using this "Human based format" but in the end we still need to convert it to a "Display based format". This does incur a slight penalty to performance sure. Thankfully we have long passed the 1990's and 2000's where this made a significant difference. When it comes modern hardware this is essentially "free".

As mentioned before there are a lot of display based formats. I've already told you about the ancient and venerable sRGB. This is one such format. However there are so many more formats, DCI-P3, Apple-p3 BT.2020 etc. JXL since it is this human based format it's effective limitations far less then the display based formats. Since JXL needs to be converted to a display based format so we can actually see the image, due to it's lesser limitations, it can be decoded to any of the aforementioned formats!

Thats right, JXL decoders by necessity have built in degree color management. If you have a wide gamut monitor and have seen images look wrong on them, obviously wrong, this is typically because the color space of the image is wrong. A good JXL implementation can pretty much make this an issue of the past. This also means that JXL is a somewhat "Future proof format." Of course innovation will come along one day which might make XYB obsolete. However when it comes to being able to store images which could be graded explicitly for this format could be a much higher quality then what we can achieve today.

#### HDR never looked right too, is that fixed as well?

In short? Sadly No. Color is complicated. Part of color is this thing called "luminance" or as many people know it as how bright something is.

This color management stuff I was talking about does not take tone mapping into consideration. Tone mapping can once again be a very complicated topic much like seemingly every single tidbit of color. However you might be wondering right now what even is tone mapping? Once again we need a primer. We need to know what a colorspace `transfer` is and why it's important. The first bit of what we need to understand that human's don't see light linearly. Imagine a light bulb. If we have a dim light bulb, and we double the power to it so it double's in brightness, humans don't perceive that as twice as bright. 

So let us imagine we have a series of numbers from 0 to 100. Each number represents the intensity of how hard a pixel, or light source is shining. 100 is as bright as it can possibly shine, and 0 is as low as it can possibly go (remember LCD panels don't actually turn off). Humans are much more sensitive to "dimness" then we are to "brightness". This works out great for us, remember how I mentioned earlier that we can't simply store the raw RGB/YUV data? This means we can actually take some of the data away from the "bright" parts of the image, and hand them over to the dark parts. 

This is what a transfer function does. It shapes how bright that stepping is so it can better correlate to how humans actually see light given the limitations we need to deal with. Different transfer functions shape that light in different ways, which allows transfer functions to actually choose how large the range of dimness to brightness it can represent. So, What does tone mapping do? Put simply tone mapping is what allows us to change between greatly different transfer functions while keeping the intended perceived lightness differences of the image.

For a very simple example on why tone mapping is important, [Here is an interactable desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hfybgg2wfc) with sRGB, Gamma 2.2 and Gamma 2.4 as well as PQ transfer curves are graphed. With an image of it directly below. See the Line sticking out like a sore thumb? That's PQ.

![embed an image of the graph](https://files.catbox.moe/1k5q5e.png)

When looking at this graph the Y axis corresponds with the intensity of light with `0` being `off` and `1` being `full intensity`. The X axis corresponds to the actual pixel value as it is actually stored in the file. The bottom parts of each segment are the actual lines, everything else is just math. You can enable and disable the lines by clicking the blue circle on the left side of the math box. It's important to note that with sRGB and Gamma2.2 full brightness is somewhere from 80 to 300 nits. It is supposed to be 80 nits, but there is some variation as to how it's actually done there and it's not uncommon to see them graded with a variety of intended max nits. With PQ however, It has a solid 10000 nit max. The Desmos link has boxes where you can adjust the peak. If you want to see it at an "Intended 1:1" scale, set PQ to "10000", and sRGB for "80". 

This show cases two things, The first being that this is why we cannot display an sRGB directly on a PQ screen, and vice versa. The lines don't get close to corresponding, which means the luminance of the image will be all sorts of messed up. To remedy this, we undo the PQ transfer and apply the sRGB transfer, However this leads into the second point

The second being why we need tonemapping. If you were to map an sRGB image intended for 80nits 1:1 on a monitor with PQ, where on average "White" will be from 200-300 nits (203 is recommended, but there is some leeway in actual implementations). Chances are you won't even be able to see a good portion of the sRGB image. The luminance would be everywhere, Dimness would be too dark, and brightness would be too bright.

Alright, Complicated stuff aside lets have a quick terminology time. sRGB is a color space. A colour space is defined as a collection of three things. A `Transfer`, a `Gamut`, and a `white point`. JXL can handle `gamut` and `white point` mapping perfectly fine, but as we covered, `transfer` is a lot more complicated to map because of the issue where intended luminance values of sRGB and PQ are greatly different. However there is actually another issue then just the luminance range. Gamma2.2 and sRGB's transfer uses something called a *relative* luminance system, and transfers like PQ use an *absolute* luminance. (PS. HLG uses a relative transfer.)

Why does this matter? Well it turns out, It does complicate things a little bit, but the main issue is that, It's not actually consistent on *what* an sRGB image is intending it's peak luminance to be. Some images are graded on a 80 nit max display, some on a 200 nit max display etc. It's actually kind of arbitrary. This means what `1.0` represents can actually change depending on the image, and this changes how we need to map it.

Even pretending we live in a perfect world where SDR peak is consistent, how do we actually do the tone mapping to make the two systems work together. Lets talk about rendering SDR on HDR for a second. This is commonly known as "Inverse Tone mapping." And this is actually a bit easier to do since we are "expanding" the image instead of "compressing" the image.

While SDR images can be roughly mapped to `1:203` where `1:` represents the peak brightness of the sRGB image, and `:203` the absolute brightness it will be displayed at. This kind of "dumb" mapping doesn't always look good sadly largely in part because of the issues we talked about before. The better solution would be to figure out the intended peak of the image, and try to do some tone mapping to 203. However considering we can rarely actually know what the source image is actually intending. Doing the naive mapping is better then none. This is always something client applications could try to expose as well.

On the other hand, imagine scenario where we do no tone mapping instead, the white image you look at on a normal screen, would be dumping an 10000nit on a theoretical perfect PQ display. To put into context how bright this is. This is about as bright as a high quality office florescent light bulb. You have one of the new HDR Ipads. Open an HDR white image, max out the brightness, go into a room and make it completely dark. This can be harsh enough that people have reported headaches from looking at it too long, and sudden exposure can actually induce discomfort and in some people minor amounts of pain. These devices are about 1000 nits of output. So dumb tone mapping is for sure better then no tone mapping at all.

And this is the *easy* form of tone mapping, HDR to SDR is **significantly** harder to do. We are now compressing the possible brightness differences, but also the maximum brightness of the image needs to be brought down significantly. Being able to reconcile the two issues isn't too hard when we are doing it by hand. We however, aren't doing it by hand, we need a one size fits all glove. This is actually very much non trivial, There are ways to do it, but they do come with a degree of difficulty and performance hit. `bt.2446a` is a great tone mapping method assuming the content is graded a very specific way. This means it's great for some content, and terrible for other content. mpv's `spline` tone mapping mode with `peak detect` and `contrast recovery` is an excellent "one size fits all" tone mapping method. It however is a rather more complex tone mapping solution, and can actually be worse then bt.2446a for well mastered content in my opinion. But of course, you have plenty of other tone mapping functions, ACES Filmic is another popular curve.

So finally, what *does* JXL do here? the JXL spec does have some tone mapping data built into it. However it leaves the actual implementation of tone mapping up to the JXL library. for instance libjxl can preform some rudimentary tone mapping when decoding the XYB image. However it is quite basic but they do the job when converting SDR to HDR. I however don't recommend it for HDR to SDR since it tends to not do a very good job, Images will usually look kind of messed up.

so yeah, HDR/SDR? Not exactly a solved problem. Nothing can easily overcome the limitations of grading an image for a specific luminance range and displaying it on a different range. However make no mistake, even if HDR doesn't become super easy with this, it is still really nice to have proper gamut support baked in. Gamut issues have plagued users long before transfer issues have.

#### OK, The HDR still kinda sucks, but everything else is great right?

Kinda. I know I said that weird colors are a thing of the past, but this is only somewhat true.

A) The benefits of this come really only when the image is XYB encoded. `cjxl` when doing lossless encoding, will not convert the image to an XYB colorspace and tag it as such (even if you grade an image in XYB and encode that with `cjxl`), but will encode the image "as is" instead. While this is good for encoding losslessly, this does sadly mean we don't get the color management benefits of this currently. `libjxl` also doesn't currently allow us to master XYB images. We can however still use very large gamut images and work down from there, so the benefit is still immediate.

Now, How much does it matter that you need to use lossy encoding? Even if something isn't lossless, that doesn't always mean the viewers will be able to tell at all. If an image is technically lossy, but it's not expected that a human consumer will be able to tell or notice degradation, these are commonly called "Visually lossless" images. (Though be warned, Lots of companies will take liberties in calling something such). 

For example, encoding an image with `cjxl -d 0.5 -e 8`, I can't tell the difference between the JXL encodes image and the original image at all. I've attempted multiple blind tests for myself and failed each one. Perhaps if I had a better monitor I could tell the difference, but when I am looking this hard, It's not an issue for delivery images at all. It's also worth noting that when doing this, there is significant space savings to be had as well.

So we have a trade off here. We don't get lossless images, however we can support any kind of image gamut pretty nicely. I would say that is a fair trade off myself at the very least.

B) When doing gamut mapping, It is a little more complicated then just decoding to the gamut. XYB can be converted to XYZ perfectly fine which works great as the middle man. However what happens when you input a BT.2020 color into a XYB, Then decode that to an sRGB image? It will look "mostly right". You see, Gamut mapping is also a little involved, but at least much less complicated then tone mapping. Much like tone mapping. The implementation of gamut mapping seems to be left up to the implementation. However at the very least, even a mediocre gamut map is better then no gamut map. Libjxl does have proper gamut mapping support, so this is not an issue for this specific case, but other implementations may not support it yet.

The other thing to note here, grading a wide gamut image, and displaying it on a lower gamut display will **always** look worse. This isn't because of the limits gamut mapping. This is because you are actually displaying it with an inferior display. If you are trying to figure out why the image looks worse, this is a likely explanation.

#### Alright enough advertisement, How do I use it?

A good question, with an easy answer. The first thing to do is make an image with an XYB encoding. While you can use any image, to showcase that this is actually working we are going to take an sRGB image and make it into a BT.2020 image. Encode your image with a lossy setting, if you don't want any easily noticable (if any) quality loss you can simply do `cjxl -e 7 -d 0.5 imagein.png imageout.jxl` (If your source is a Jpeg you will need to disable lossless Jpeg, but keep in mind that this may not actually be smaller then the source image `--lossless_jpeg=0`).

The next step is to simply decode the image to a usable format. In this case let's use PNG. To first understand how djxl decodes image colorspace. let's take a look at this example cmdline. `djxl --color_space RGB_D65_SRG_Per_SRG in.jxl sRGB.png`

in.jxl and out.png are simple. but what about the color_space option?, it breaks down like so. 1_2_3_4_5.

1. Pixel format. This is the format of the pixels themselves.
2. White point. Part of a colorspace is white point, it defines how "warm" white is.
3. Gamut. as we talked about before, this is what we will need to change to support various gamut formats.
4. Rendering intent. This is tells us how we should shrink the gamut of the image.
5. Transfer. As we talked about before transfer is important because it shapes the light intensity. Ideally we wouldn't muck about here.

So what does this cmdline do? It decodes the image as RGB pixels, D65 white point, sRGB gamut (also known as BT.709), Perceptual rendering intent, with an sRGB transfer. Modifying this to support BT.2020 is easy enough, although it's not well documented. we can use `djxl --color_space RGB_D65_202_Per_SRG in.jxl 2020.png`. This replaces the SRG gamut with a 202 section which stands for the BT.2020 gamut. We can know open these images in any viewer that doesn't do automatic gamut mapping to compare them and yup! One image is in BT.2020 and another in sRGB. If you open in a viewer that doesn't to gamut mapping BT.2020 will look "wrong". However when we open it up in an app that does do gamut mapping like `mpv`. We can see that the image does look proper still, while `mpv` is reporting a BT.2020 in the gamut.

As for something a little cool, we can also export directly to XYB. This could potentially be useful if you want to run a color managed app. You can directly convert the XYB to whatever format the app you are using is on. `djxl --color_space XYB_Per in.jxl XYB.png`. I have also heard reports that people have been using XYB to squeeze more quality out of Jpeg images. I can't comment on this since it isn't something I have personally tinkered with. 

Finally, let's talk a bit about HDR and SDR. As you may have figured it out, we can also export HDR images or SDR images as we please. As said above, I only recommend doing from SDR to HDR. We can export it like so `djxl --color_space RGB_D65_202_Per_PeQ --display_nits=1000 in.jxl HDR.png` or we can use `djxl --color_space RGB_D65_202_Per_HLG --display_nits=100 in.jxl HDR.png`. There is a non insignificant chance you will encounter some visible brightness changes. However you will generally get close enough that it will be fine. You can try and tinker with the values to try and get the image as close as possible.

## Hey, You said that HDR is hard? But I heard about this new tech called "Gain maps", what about that?

So while I just talked about how luminance tone mapping is actually pretty complicated (particularly when dealing with HDR to SDR), there is however something that is promising to make it much easier for us. Gain maps are an additional image layer that can be used to add extra luminance information to SDR images, effectively allowing us to create both an HDR image and an SDR image at the same time, in the same file, with minimal overhead.

These aren't quite as good as native HDR images, they do have limitations. Despite this,      users who consume these images still get the "HDR" benefit and a lot of consumers find this to be quite good. On the other hand, people with a traditional SDR display don't have to worry about the complicated tone mapping mentioned previously, They will still receive the SDR picture as the original artist intended it. Whether this be Digital artist or a photographer, Both SDR and HDR users can enjoy a first class experience. 

So after all this, does JXL support gain maps? Well no? Gain maps aren't a part of the JXL spec, but they also aren't a part of JPEG's spec either. Readers may be pleased to hear that JXL allows a large number of layers. This means JXL can "natively support" encoding gain map images, and while there is no spec for this the potential for this use case is there. It's up to ecosystem to decide whether or not this will be a route they will go.

## I have a need for speed that can't be satiated, but oh boy does JXL get close.

The decode speed of lossy JXL images is actually really fast. Ok, yeah sure, even a potato can decode a single image. However lets say we have 30 images on screen at once. "Who needs that?" one may ask. Galleries of course! There are hundreds of galleries on the web, in our phones, on our PCs. JXL is certainly fast enough here, However what if I want something faster, what if when I say I have a need for speed, **I mean real speed**.

Something I have been testing for a while is using JXL image sequences as a mezzanine format. A very quick TLDR on what a mezzanine format is, it's a video format comprised of a sequence of still photos designed to make video editing faster. One needs only three major things from a mezzanine.

1. Still images for instant frame perfect seeking. 
2. Fast enough decode speed to make scrubbing multiple videos on a timeline smooth. 
3. Consistently high quality.

Does JXL do satisfy this criteria? For still images, Obviously yes, we wouldn't be hear right now if this was a no. As for consistently high quality, JXL can do this quite nicely on the higher effort levels for sure which I will show case a bit later.

So, how fast *is* lossy jxl on my ryzen 2600?

* 30fps? Are you a beginner driver or elderly driver? I can't tell.
* 60fps? Maybe you can enter turtle races. (Lossless JXL can be found here. Magically faster then some PNG sequences for me somehow...)
* 90fps? We are barely scratching usable.
* 150fps? At least we are getting somewhere.
* 200+fps. Ah, Here you are!

Yeah, that's pretty fast, "But Quack! CineForm is much faster then that! And ProRes is even faster!!!" Okay yeah that is true. I lost on this battle, but they are also about 2x the size for similar quality. If you run out of SSD space for your mezzanines, it has happened to me twice, and I swear it will not again. (I said this the first time too.) You will learn the true meaning of slow. Using JXL allows me to get double the footage and avoid potential bandwidth bottlenecks which can cause timeline performance to suffer as well.

I'm not lying either, this was taken from December of year 2023 200+FPS with `mpv` under Wayland using Vulkan + mailbox using a Linux desktop with sway compositor.

![marine-unison](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/673202643916816384/1182221278430634014/image.png)

And it scales across multiple videos pretty decently too. ![many marine](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/673202643916816384/1182221277776314398/image.png)

I made this video by encoding the video to png, then I used the following commandline to encode the PNG to JXL, I then muxed that JXL sequence into an mkv and played it back using `mpv` the command is as follows. `cjxl -e 3 -d 1 --faster_decoding=4`

So how useful is this for a mezzanine? 200fps is just about scratching the surface as usable. I wouldn't use it in any complicated workflows, however if you are only working with 2 or 3 simultanious video clips at a time, Then JXL could very well be useful here. Im pretty excited to see how far JXL will go in this area. Faster CPUs will mean faster decode times, and I am sure that the `faster_decoding` flag could likely be optimized too. We may also see potential optimizations when it comes to libjxl's decoder, or potentially alternative, faster decoders.

"OK quack, That's cool and all, but not everyone cares about a video, I just want to make sure my old craptop will load them fast enough. What about Mr. Low end? No no, Not you old desktop low? I mean **low** end"

Sure, you want low end? do you remember those old windows netbooks? I do, in fact I have one right here!.

Now, lets see how fast libjxl can be. If you have a JXL enabled browser, the images will embed for you! If not, the links will be at the bottom of this section


The first test is a 4k JXL image encoded from a JPEG image using `cjxl -d 0 -e 7 --lossless_jpeg=0` It for sure takes a while to decode, This isn't something I would want to look at on a regular basis. Lossless images encoded through `cjxl -e7` really don't have the greatest decode speed on a modern PC, and we can see this hits us hard here. Thankfully, you probably won't come across too many of these on devices this old anyways.

For this next image, This is "The Woag". It is an 8k image lossless encode using `cjxl -e 7 -d 0` with Jpeg reconstruction. The rendering of this image might even slow down a desktop browser! However we can see when it comes to decoding the image keeping the jpeg reconstruction support actually saves us a lot of time despite this image being twice as large being an 8k test image.

And finally we have an image encoded with `cjxl -e 7 -d 1` from a PNG source. This is more likely the images you will wind up coming across. This for sure is still too slow to be usable for a many images. Then again, the laptop itself is a little to slow to even do modern browsing.

![<JXL> I may have a small addiction to Genshin, The game is great and so is the art you are missing!](https://files.catbox.moe/6o1t4r.jxl)

As you can see, Even on a really old 1GB dual core atom, JXL is surprisingly fast. I wouldn't recommend browsing a JXL enabled page. But I also wouldn't recommend using one of these machines in the first place. It is also worth noting that this is an Arch linux Live boot, not a full install. This might negatively effect speed a bit too. Considering these devices were hardly usable when they were new however, I consider this at least a small win.

## Can you tell me how consistent the main JXL encoder is? You mentioned it before.

I will be using the same video as when I showcased the speed of jxl inside of MPV. but I will go into a bit more depth on how to compare here. I used different settings here because I wanted to optimize more for quality then filesize, however the decode speed is the same.

So there are two methods we can use for encoding the image sequence, the easy method for this would be to use FFmpeg for this. While this is a valid method, I want to use a bit of a slower effort, and FFmpeg isn't great at parallelizing this. Instead, I will use FFmpeg to decode the image sequence into a series of PNG images. I am mainly doing this because it's fast enough, and using different formats makes this just a wee bit easier on me. The encode I will run is `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v png img-seq\frame-%04d.png` to decode the images to a folder called img-seq.

The next step is to encode each frame into JXL, for this Linux users can use `parallel -j NUM cjxl -e 6 -d 0.5 --faster_decoding=4 {} {.}.jxl` where NUM is the number of parallel threads. On windows you can use powershell like so `ForEach -Parallel`, or you can use a tool like [rust-parallel](https://github.com/aaronriekenberg/rust-parallel) which is a windows compatible parallel command execution tool similar to parallel. To use rust-parallel you can use ```ls -name | rust-parallel.exe -p -j 4 -r '(.*).(png)' cjxl.exe -e 6 -d 0.5 --faster_decoding=4 `{0`} `{1`}.jxl``` (The backticks are to escape the {} in powershell. They are needed because powershell uses them for expressions.)

It's easier to move the JXL and PNG images into their own folders so do that now. I will then decode the JXL images back to png, because the tool I will be using is `ssimulacra2_rs` and it uses vapoursynth for input. This makes it great for doing per frame testing, however the most of the common input tools on windows don't support JXL yet. If you are on linux you may be able to skip this step as the tools may support JXL depending on how they are compiled which may be up to your distro. On windows I can use ```ls -name | rust-parallel.exe -p -j 4 -r '(.*).(jxl)' djxl.exe `{0`} `{1`}.png``` to convert the frames back to PNG.

My main folder now has two sub folders. `jxl/frame-%04d.png` and `png/frame-%04d.png` where the png folder is the source, and the jxl folder is the encoded ones.

Next we create two vpy files that we can use them as inputs. This allows us to compare them as an image sequence instead of individually, this is a bit faster and lets us graph the output. using ssimulacra2_rs' video function  create one file for JXL folder, and one file for PNG folder. the JXL folder is given below

```
import vapoursynth as vs
core = vs.core
clip = core.lsmas.LWLibavSource(source='jxl/frame-%04d.png')
clip = core.resize.Bicubic(clip=clip, format=vs.YUV444P10, matrix_s="709")
clip.set_output(0)
```

Finally execute this command to run the comparison program. `ssimulacra2_rs.exe video -f NUM_THREADS -g png.vpy jxl.vpy`. `ssimulacra2_rs` is quite slow for comparing videos since the original `ssimulacra2rs` was designed for single images, however it is quite an accurate method of comparing images/videos to one another. As we can with the graph below, JXL manages to exceed 90 ssimu2 the vast majority of the time, as is for sure good enough for a mezzanine format.

![The output graph for JXL](https://files.catbox.moe/8m6glg.png)

How does this compare with prores? Good question using `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v prores_ks -profile hq ...` these were the scores I got.

![Prores](https://files.catbox.moe/1zxjul.png)

Prores had a wee bit better average, but it's lows were worse then JXL's. However since anything close to and past a 90 is usually good enough for a mezzanine I would consider both good here. But how does file size compare? JXL: `1.26 GiB` Prores: `4.15 GiB` As we can see, JXL is less then half the size! We could probably use some of that savings to bump the quality some by using `-d 0.25` instead, but for me it simply isn't necessary.

It could be nice to allot some more savings to faster decode, however at the current time, increasing libjxl's `faster_decoding` flag doesn't seem to do too much so increasing it further doesn't actually change anything, the image is the same size, and the decode speed is the same as well.

## OK, JXL is kinda cool. I would use it but man, C++ sucks.
I hear you loud and clear. If it was any louder I might go deaf. I know the pain for sure. I myself am not the biggest fan either. However [have no fear, Rust is here!](https://github.com/tirr-c/jxl-oxide) Well for decoding at least. But still! `jxl-oxide` is a third party, native rust decoder, and while it isn't as fast as libjxl, it is still pretty fast. The important part of jxl-oxide however, Is not the dual MIT/BSD license, It's not that rust is the best programming language ever. It's this, 

```
➜  jxl-oxide git:(main) RUSTFLAGS='-C code-model=small -C debuginfo=none -C opt-level=z -C strip=symbols -C codegen-units=1 -C panic=abort -C target-feature=+crt-static' cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release
--SNIP--
➜  jxl-oxide git:(main) ldd ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jxl-dec
        statically linked
➜  jxl-oxide git:(main) ls -llh ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jxl-dec
-rwxr-xr-x 2 quack quack 3.4M Nov 19 23:11 ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jxl-dec
➜  jxl-oxide git:(main) upx --lzma --best ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jxl-dec
--SNIP--
➜  jxl-oxide git:(main) ls -llh ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jxl-dec
-rwxr-xr-x 1 quack quack 966K Nov 19 23:11 ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jxl-dec
```

That's right, with a simple cargo build command line, we can make a 3.4M binary to decode to either PNG or npy, with proper static compilation so it will run on almost any Linux system, and when we use `UPX` to compress it, it's a mere 966K. No need to muck about dependencies. No need for weird cross compile shenanigans and these sizes are without rebuilding std. (Note: I use -C opt-level=z here, but that doesn't save much space at all if you are using `UPX`)

Thanks to being rust, this also means you can easily use jxl-oxide crate in your projects. There is even a usable [wasm demo](https://gitlab.com/nitroxis/jxl-wasm) too for people who would want to use it targeting that. (I didn't include it on this page due to the 16k woag image. Wasm might be fast, but no matter what wasm has it's limitations. However jxl-oxide does seem a bit more reliable then libjxl for this usecase.)

jxl-oxide recently (as of December 2023) has had some work done on internal colour management support. It may still have some limitations compared to `djxl`, but the primary benefits I've said before all still apply. You can export the wide gamut images to small gamut or vice versa. This of course can and likely will improve over time as well. 

But how does it preform on that crappy laptop from before? Well not great, Jxl-oxide works fine on newer systems, but when you load it on this crappy laptop...

```

```

Ouch. The results speak for themselves. However it's worth noting that this is a 32bit binary compiled with generic compile settings. This means it was built without even so much as SSE support which hurts a lot. That ram limitation also hits really hard, Keep in mind that this image is `5221x2847`. Make no mistake however, jxl-oxide is still a competent decoder for any somewhat modern machine that has remotely close to a reasonable amount of ram. Of course, there are always optimizations to be made.

```

  djxl mona.jxl --disable_output ran

```

This was tested on a arch WSL2 instance on my Ryzen 2600. While yes, jxl-oxide is slower, it's certainly no slouch either. It is still well within reasonable speeds. Just make sure to either compile it with native optimizations, or simply spring for a 64bit PC instead.

## A great colour space, Easy decoder, Amazing flexibility and speed to boot! What am I missing out on here?

Well, Support, JXL is still a new format, at the time of writing, On android, you wont find it any android gallery app that I know off, only a couple apps actually go out of their way to support it like the popular manga app `tachiyomi`. Since android doesn't support JXL there is little support here. Hopefully one day we might see official platform support here. I wish for at least an open source gallery app to pick it up.

Specifically for webbrowsers, you wont find too much support here with either with Chrome removing support, and Firefox being Firefox and ignoring the issue outright. However thanks to the community, there are many forks available of both browsers that have good support. I currently use `Thorium` and `Waterfox` on desktop, and `Cromite` on android. Also Webkit based browsers like `Safari` and `Gnome web` also support JXL officially for a while, but now thanks to apple pushing the ecosystem they have been enabled by default. I guess apple does what Firefox doesn't.

Linux support is great. However keep in mind that people in general have a misconception about how Linux handles these things. Linux relies on the application themselves to support nearly everything. There is no generic platform support for these. There are just... a lot of platforms to choose from some more generic then others.  Thankfully however, independent app ecosystems are generally pretty good, both QT and GTK support JXL, dedicated tooling like imagemagick and FFmpeg support it too. So you shouldn't have too many issues here.

As alluded to above, Apple is doing great here. They are offering platform support for JXL on both IOS and OSX now so you should have zero issues here soon enough as long as you are up to date on any of the apple ecosystem devices.

As for windows, there is a plugin to add it to windows imaging component. It works ok, it's pretty limited but its... fine. It of course is not official support. Hopefully soon windows will decide to officially support JXL.

#### Is there anything I can do to help?

You can help push adoption by recommending it to people who can use it and doing so yourself. Asking your applications you use often to support it. Websites are already serving JXL too, and some like this page you are viewing won't even work 100% properly without JXL support. So you can report those websites as broken. 

If you run a website, You can start serving JXL today. Many CDNs support JXL for customers, If you aren't serving a large amount of images on a single page, you always have the option to implement utilize WASM decoder. I have run into an issue that despite JXL decoding fast enough, image rendering will actually be paused while another image is decoding. If anyone knows how to prevent chrome and Firefox from doing this, send me a message on mastodon or perhaps even make a PR [at this repo](https://github.com/Quackdoc/jxl-wasm). I would love to get that working and enable it here.


## Notes.
#### Color

In this article I took some liberties with the terminology and explanations to keep it simple for people who may have not come across these terms and don't have great knowledge into the subject matter. This was particularly done when talking about color. 

Some liberties I took; 

* Human based formats vs display based format. YUV/YCbCr would actually be closer to a human based format then a display based format.
* I somewhat interchangeably used format and color space when color space should have been used.
* HDR isn't a well defined term if at all defined. I used it to refer to a certain classification of transfers, however it has been historically used for other forms of "Dynamic range" too. the term "HDR" itself should be treated as buzzword unless it is refereed to in the context of some kind of spec.
* I'm sure I took a lot more here too


For readers who wish to learn about the proper terminology, explanations, and gain a better in-depth knowledge into color. I highly recommend reading into these sources

[Hitchhikers guide to digital color.](https://hg2dc.com/) The language is crass but the knowledge is first class for an introduction into color.

[This is a git repo](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pq/color-and-hdr/)  containing a large variety of information for color and HDR information intended for developers, The knowledge at this time isn't well structured, but it is a great repository of info.

[Bruce Lindbloom's website](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/) has some of the best knowledge when it comes to some of the math behind the core concepts of working with color.

[Cinematic color](https://cinematiccolor.org/) talks about color management in the context of media production.

[A PDF](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs148-10-summer/docs/2010--kerr--cie_xyz.pdf) about the history and some technical aspects of the XYZ and xyY colorspaces. A significant colorspace when it comes to detailing how human vision works and conversions between formats.

#### Speed

It likely is possible to gain more decode speed with libjxl by tinkering with the encode settings. However these are things I don't expect anyone to muck about with themselves. Even the test I modified will need someone to put some effort in to prepare their pipeline, as FFmpeg does not currently, at the time of writing this, decode JXL videos when muxed into MKV or Nut files without a patch. However this may change at some point. 

#### Rust vs C++

Ok, No I don't actually *hate* C++, However some developers of various projects [like renpy](https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/3865) have complained about pulling libjxl into their build chain before and it not playing nice. For some projects, jxl-oxide might indeed be significantly easier to pull into their build chain, but as it stands, I don't believe jxl-oxide can actively be built as a library and directly integrated with other languages. I may be mistaken on this however.
